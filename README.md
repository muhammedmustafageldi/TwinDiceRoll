# TwinDiceRoll ðŸŽ²

TwinDiceRoll is a simple iOS app built with Swift that simulates rolling two dice. Upon pressing the roll button, the app randomly generates values between 1 and 6 for each die and displays them on the screen. This app is my first iOS project, created to practice basic Swift and UIKit concepts.

## Features

- Two dice images are displayed on the screen.
- Press the "Roll" button to randomly change the values of both dice.
- Basic use of buttons, image views, and randomization in Swift.
